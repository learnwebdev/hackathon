    <p>You can choose to work either individually or in a team. You are more than welcome to ask your peers for debugging help, but all commits to the repository must be from you or your team.</p>
    <p>Each participant must be a current member of the <a class="link" href="https://slashrocket.io">slashrocket community</a>. You will log in using your Slack credentials and submit your entry to this site.</p>
    <p>Each team project will have a corresponding post created on their behalf on the <a class="link" href="https://community.slashrocket.io">slashrocket community forum</a>. This is where the team can post updates, issues, or any other relevant information about the project.</p>
    <h3>Your Project Must:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>contain nothing illegal or malicious.</li>
      <li>be your original work. That goes for code, design, sounds, etc. You can use third-party libraries as long as you give appropriate credit and citations in your repo's README. Make sure all used assets are freely available to the public.</li>
      <li>be open source. It must be deployed and hosted somewhere that the community can view and you must provide a link to the code repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Voting</h3>
    <p>Community voting will take place in the <a class="link" href="https://community.slashrocket.io">slashrocket community forum</a>. Make sure you are signed up through Slack otherwise you may not be eligible to vote. It will begin 24 hours after the hackathon has ended and will be open for 7 days.</p>
